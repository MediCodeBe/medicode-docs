#Intervention reports
MediCode give the ability to register an intervention report after a transport. Every transport can hold 1 interventionreport. When the interventionreport is created there show a new tab on the transports page. On this page you can add multiple parameter reports to the interventionreport.

- **Oxygen** - *This is the flow rate of the oxygen in liters/minute (value between 0 and 25).*
- **Oxygen administration** - *This is method of the oxygen administration.*
- **Airway** - *This is the method of airway management.*
- **Stabilisation** - *This is the method of stabilisation.*
- **CPR time** - *This is the time of CPR in minutes.*
- **AED shocks** - *These are the number of shocks during the CPR.*
- **Notes** - *These are some additional notes.*

###Parameter reports
After the interventionreport is created you can add parameter reports. You can add as many parameter reports as you like to a interventionreport.

###Create an parameter report
When adding a parameter report these fields are fillable.

- **Heart rate** - *This is the heart rate of the patient (in beats/minute).*
- **Heart rate regular** - *This determines whether the heart rate is regular or not.*
- **Heart rate weak** - *This determines whether the heart rate is weak or strong.*
- **Oxygen saturation** - *This is the oxygen saturation (SpO2) of the patient. (in %).*
- **Glycaemia** - *This is the glycaemia of the patient. (in mg/dl).*
- **Temperature** - *This is the temperature of the patient. (in Â°C).*
- **Respiratory rate** - *This is the respiratory rate of the patient. (in breaths/minute).*
- **Systolic BP** - *This is the systolic bloodpressure of the patient. (in mmHg).*
- **Diastolic BP** - *This is the diastolic bloodpressure of the patient. (in mmHg).*
- **GCS Eye response** - *This is the eye response of the Glasgow coma scale.*
- **GCS Verbal response** - *This is the verbal response of the Glasgow coma scale.*
- **GCS Motor response** - *This is the motor response of the Glasgow coma scale.*
- **AVPU** - *This determines whether the patient is "Alert", "Verbal", "Pain" or "Unresponsive"*
- **NRS Pain scale** - *This numeric pain rating scale. 0 is for no pain, 10 is for very heavy pain*
- **Pupils** - *This determines whether the pupils are normal or not.*
- **Pupils equal** - *This determines whether the pupils are equal or not.*
